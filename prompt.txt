Would you like me to **generate this project’s folder structure and base code (Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion)** right now?  
I can scaffold the files and include:  
- `app/page.tsx` (hero + services + clients)  
- `next-seo.config.ts`  
- `components/AnimatedLogo.tsx`, `ClientSlider.tsx`, `BlogCard.tsx`, etc.
