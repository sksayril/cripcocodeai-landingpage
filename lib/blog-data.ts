    content: `
      React has revolutionized the way we build web applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything from the fundamentals to advanced concepts.

      ## Getting Started with React

      React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components and manage application state efficiently.

      ### Key Concepts

      - Components: The building blocks of React applications
      - Props: Data passed between components
      - State: Component-level data management
      - Hooks: Modern way to handle state and side effects

      ## Advanced React Patterns

      As you grow more comfortable with React, you'll encounter various patterns that make your code more maintainable and scalable.

      ### Component Composition

      Component composition is the practice of combining smaller components to build more complex UIs.

      ### Custom Hooks

      Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions.

      ## Best Practices

      1. Keep components small and focused
      2. Use meaningful component and variable names
      3. Implement proper error boundaries
      4. Optimize performance with React.memo and useMemo
      5. Follow consistent file structure

      ## Conclusion

      React continues to be one of the most popular libraries for web development. By following best practices and understanding core concepts, you can build amazing applications.

      TypeScript has become the de facto standard for building large-scale JavaScript applications. Let's explore why.

      ## What is TypeScript?

      TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other powerful features to the language.

      ### Type Safety

      The primary benefit of TypeScript is type safety, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

      ### Better Developer Experience

      TypeScript provides excellent IDE support with features like:

      - Intelligent code completion
      - Inline documentation
      - Refactoring tools
      - Type checking

      ## Key Features

      1. Static typing
      2. Interface definitions
      3. Generics
      4. Decorators
      5. Advanced type inference

      ## When to Use TypeScript

      TypeScript is particularly beneficial for:

      - Large codebases
      - Team projects
      - Long-term maintenance
      - Complex applications

      ## Best Practices

      Follow these practices to get the most out of TypeScript:

      1. Enable strict mode
      2. Use interfaces for object shapes
      3. Avoid using 'any' type
      4. Leverage union types
      5. Create reusable generic types

      ## Conclusion

      TypeScript significantly improves code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity, making it essential for modern web development.
